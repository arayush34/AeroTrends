## Introduction

AeroTrends is a data analysis project that provides valuable insights into flight trends and pricing for different airlines and routes. The dataset includes information on flight parameters such as price, class, and stops for multiple airlines and cities.

## Key Insights

### 1. Mean vs. Median Prices

Even though the mean price of flights is calculated to be 20,889, it is important to note that the dataset includes both Business and Economy class tickets. The median price, which is around 7,425, better represents the central tendency of prices and takes into account the presence of both classes.

### 2. Cost of Travel from Delhi

Analysis of the graph indicates that travel from Delhi to other locations tends to be less expensive compared to travel from other cities to Delhi. Therefore, Delhi is a recommended destination for cost-effective trips.

### 3. Optimal Time of Travel

Flights departing or arriving late at night appear to be the least expensive option. Additionally, flights in the afternoon are slightly more affordable than those in the evening, morning, and late-night hours.

### 4. Cheapest Airlines for Economy Flights

From the data, it is evident that AirAsia and Air_India offer the cheapest range of Economy class flights.

### 5. Air_India vs. Vistara Business Class

The analysis reveals that Air_India provides cheaper Business class flights compared to Vistara Business class.

### 6. Price Gap between Economy and Business Class

There is a significant price gap between Economy and Business class tickets, as expected.

### 7. Effect of Remaining Days on Prices

As the number of remaining days decreases, the flight prices tend to rise for both Economy and Business class tickets.

### 8. Influence of Stops on Prices

With the exception of AirAsia, flights with more stops generally result in higher ticket prices.

## Data Processing

Outliers were not removed from the Price data, as the analysis focuses on real-world scenarios where last-minute tickets can be expensive. Additionally, the dataset includes Business class flights, making the presence of outliers justifiable.

## Conclusion

AeroTrends offers valuable insights into flight pricing trends, optimal travel times, and cost-effective airlines for various classes. The data analysis can assist travelers in making informed decisions and help airlines improve their pricing strategies.
